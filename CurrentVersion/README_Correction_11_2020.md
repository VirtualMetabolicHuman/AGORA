# AGORA 1.03

This folder contains a corrected version of AGORA 1.03 (released 25.02.2019). A reaction present in four Clostridium difficile reconstructions was corrected which contained a mitochondrial metabolite. This reaction was blocked in previous versions and had no effect on simulations. Moreover, a duplicate metabolite (indprp/ind3ppa) was resolved by replacing all instances of indprp with ind3ppa.
For changes performed between AGORA 1.02 and AGORA 1.03, please refer to the file "README_Changes_in_AGORA_1_03.md".

#### Summary of changes made in AGORA version 1.03, released 25.02.2019

## Additions in the updated version:
In the present update, the 818 AGORA were expanded by several pathways and further curated against newly available experimental data. Moreover, an extensive correction of predictions that disagree with experimental data as well as quality control/quality assurance of reconstruction properties was performed with the help of a test suite (publication in preparation).

Experimental data from several recent publications (Table 1) was retrieved and served as the input for the data-driven curation and expansion of pathways in AGORA. First, 54 AGORA reconstructions were refined based on defined growth media reported by Tramontano et al [1] for the corresponding 54 organisms (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, an improved pipeline was used to resolve false positive predictions of required nutrients in all reconstructions with available experimental data (see below). Growth on the media was enabled by combining the gap-filling reactions proposed by Tramontano et al. with gap-filling performed by the AGORA pipeline. Second, a comparative genomic analysis of a recently described pathway for aromatic amino acid degradation [2] was performed and the corresponding reactions were added to AGORA. Third, comparative genomic data was retrieved from a recent study on putrefaction pathways in gut microbes [3] and the corresponding reactions were reconstructed. Fourth, the 12Î±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction, and the trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase reaction were added based on a comparative genomic analysis of the respective, recently described genes [4, 5]. Fifth, novel carbon sources were added based on recent experimental evidence [6]. Sixth, 5-aminovalerate fermentation to valerate was reconstructed for Clostridium viride DSM 6836 [7]. Seventh, experimental data on B-vitamin secretion as well as secretion of vitamin K and GABA was gathered [8-23] and secretion of these compounds was enabled in the corresponding reconstructions. Finally, we recently performed a comparative genomic analysis of mucin degradation pathways in the gut microbiome [24]. The corresponding pathways were reconstructed with great biochemical detail.
For all added pathways (Table 1), it was also ensured that the added reactions could carry flux in every reconstruction....

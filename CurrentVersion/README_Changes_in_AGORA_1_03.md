# AGORA 1.03

This folder contains a corrected version of AGORA 1.03 (released 25.02.2019). Specifically, syntax errors in gene-protein-reaction rules (GPRs) were corrected in three reconstructions. These syntax errors had no effect on model predictions but were preventing loading the reconstructions through the readCbModel function in recent versions of the COBRA Toolbox.

For changes performed between AGORA 1.02 and AGORA 1.03, please refer to the README file in Previous_Versions/AGORA1.03 in this repository.
